# WebRTC with react

This is a simple video chat room example using react with webRTC and share screen API. This is experimental for learnig purposes. I hope that this project help you to learn something. You can test this on https://video-chat.dgurgel.now.sh put a room id that you want to create and click enter the other peer have to use the same room id. Sometimes it takes a bit longer to connect(no longer than one minute).
